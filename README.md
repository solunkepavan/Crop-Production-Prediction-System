# Crop_production_prediction
Crop_production_prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the crop production of a district based on the inputs such as District_Name, Crop_Year, Season, Crop and Area.

The project utilizes a BaggingRegressor from the sklearn.ensemble module, which is an ensemble method that combines multiple instances of a base regressor to make a final prediction. Additionally, it employs a LinearDiscriminantAnalysis from the sklearn.discriminant_analysis module, which is a classification algorithm that can also be used for dimensionality reduction by finding linear combinations of features to best separate two or more classes.
